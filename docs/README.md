## Instructions to getting started locally:

Install the package as editable with the docs optional dependencies: `pip install -e ".[docs]"`.
Then, navigate to `./docs` and run

```sh
$ make html
$ open _build/html/index.html
```

## Updating the documentation:

All the documentation files live in docs/source. Index.rst is the landing page. Under contents is a
list of all the sections to this documentation which are linked to their own rst or md files.
We use `MyST` to integrate markdown into our docs pages.

In order to add a new section, first update the index.rst to have the name of the section under contents.
Then create a "section_name".rst file making sure that the "section_name" matches the one in index.rst.
Alternatively you can write Markdown files following the MyST guidelines for rst integration.

## Auto generate API Documentation

Force deletes only the existing rst files that were generated by this command to update with
the new documentation in the solardatatools directory:

```sh
$ sphinx-apidoc -o ./source ../solardatatools -f
```

## To execute the changes locally for testing (make sure to be in the ./docs directory)

```sh
$ make clean
$ make html
$ open _build/html/index.html
```

## Changes merged to main auto update on [solar-data-tools docs](https://solar-data-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) via a web hook
