# Solar Data Tools User Guide

This guide serves as a reference for the typical Solar Data Tools user. We will go over the main 
classes and methods that the packages offers, with examples and relevant details for you to get started.

```{warning}
For a more comprehensive list of all methods and functions, you can check the [API reference](../reference/api.rst).
However, note that this user guide likely provides you with all the functionality you need, while the rest of 
the functions listed in the API reference are more internal/helper functions that were not meant for users to interact with.
```

If any part of this guide is unclear, or you'd like to improve on these docs, please consider [submitting an Issue or a PR](../index_dev.md)!
