The `PVInsight Technical Report <https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1897181>`_ is an in-depth report that includes details of
the Solar Data Tools project, including detailed descriptions of the tools and the main pipeline algorithms provided by the project.

This `IEEE PVSC 2024 paper <https://ieee-pvsc.org/online/manuscripts/pvsc_52-manuscript-553-1717793929.pdf>`_ provides
details specifically on the automatic loss factor analysis of the unlabeled PV energy data
(a method of the main DataHandler class), including a description how the total energy loss was attributed to different
loss factors using Shapley values.

The estimation of the location and orientation algorithm (also a method of the DataHandler class) is described in this
`IEEE 2021 PVSC paper <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9518783>`_.
