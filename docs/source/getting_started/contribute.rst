******************************
Contribute and Report Problems
******************************

To report a problem, a bug or any issue with Solar Data Tools, we recommend submitting a `GitHub Issue`_ about it.
First make sure there isn't already an open issue reporting the same problem.
If not, you can follow the instructions in our Contribution Guidelines to submit a new issue.

For code and documentation contributions, our :doc:`../../index_dev` will help you get started--from setting up a development environment
to submitting a pull request. We are still in the process of developing our guidelines, so if anything is unclear, or if you'd like more clarity on
some parts of the documentation, please consider submitting a `GitHub Issue`_!
